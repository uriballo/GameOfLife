# JOHN CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine. 

In this implementation you can create a initial configuration using left and right click to turn a cell alive or dead respectively and space to pause the evolution.
